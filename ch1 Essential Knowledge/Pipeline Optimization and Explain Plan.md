### Using Explain Plans

When using the MongoDB Query Language (MQL) to develop queries, it is important to view the explain plan for a query to
determine if you've used the appropriate index and if you need to optimise other aspects of the query or the data model.
An explain plan allows you to understand fully the performance implications of the query you have created.
However, with aggregations, an explain plan even more critical because considerably more complex logic can be assembled
and run in the database.

The MongoDB database engine will do its best to apply its own aggregation pipeline optimisations at runtime.
Nevertheless, there could be some optimisations that only you can make. cause a pipeline in such a way as to risk
changing the functional behaviour and outcome of the pipeline.
But an explain plan allows you to understand the database engine's applied optimisations and detect further potential
optimisations you can manually implement in the pipeline.

#### Viewing An Explain Plan

To view the explain plan for an aggregation pipeline, you can execute commands such as the following:

As with MQL, there are three different verbosity modes that you can generate an explain plan with, as shown below:

db.coll.explain("queryPlanner").aggregate(pipeline); //(**default** if no verbosity parameter provided)
db.coll.explain("executionStats").aggregate(pipeline);// ExecutionStats verbosity
db.coll.explain("allPlansExecution").aggregate(pipeline);// AllPlansExecution verbosity


### Let assume a pipeline like this
```javascript
var pipeline = [
    // Unpack each order from customer orders array as a new separate record
    {
        "$unwind": {
            "path": "$orders",
        }
    },

    // Match on only one customer
    {
        "$match": {
            "customer_id": "tonijones@myemail.com",
        }
    },

    // Sort customer's purchases by most expensive first
    {
        "$sort": {
            "orders.value": -1,
        }
    },

    // Show only the top 3 most expensive purchases
    {"$limit": 3},

    // Use the order's value as a top level field
    {
        "$set": {
            "order_value": "$orders.value",
        }
    },

    // Drop the document's id and orders sub-document from the results
    {
        "$unset": [
            "_id",
            "orders",
        ]
    },
];
```

### Query Plan
```javascript
    //aggregate plan
const c = await db.collection(COLLECITON_NAME).aggregate(pipeline)
const result = await c.explain("queryPlanner")

  var output = { stages: [
      {
         '$cursor': {
            queryPlanner: {
               parsedQuery: {
                  customer_id: {
                     '$eq': 'tonijones@myemail.com'
                  }
               },
               winningPlan: {
                  stage: 'FETCH',
                  inputStage: {
                     stage: 'IXSCAN',
                     keyPattern: {
                        customer_id: 1
                     },
                     indexName: 'customer_id_1',
                     direction: 'forward',
                     indexBounds: {
                        customer_id: [
                           '["tonijones@myemail.com", "tonijones@myemail.com"]'
                        ]
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         }
      },
      {
         '$unwind': {
            path: '$orders'
         }
      },
      {
         '$sort': {
            sortKey: {
               'orders.value': -1
            },
            limit: 3
         }
      },
      {
         '$set': {
            order_value: '$orders.value'
         }
      },
      {
         '$project': {
            _id: false,
            orders: false
         }
      }
   ]}
```
To optimise the aggregation, the database engine has reordered the $match to the top of the pipeline. The database engine moves the content of $match at first stage of the pipeline stages The $cursor runtime stage .
It is always the first action executed for any aggregation.

To further optimise the aggregation, the database engine has collapsed the $sort and $limit into a single specialinternal sort stage which can perform both actions in one go. 
In this situation, pipeline does not have to hold the whole data set in memory when sorting, which requiring more RAM than is available.


### executionStats
**executionStats variant is the most informative mode.**
Rather than showing just the query planner's thought process, it provides actual statistics on the execution plan (e.g.
the total keys examined, the total docs examined, etc.).
However, this isn't the default because it actually executes the aggregation in addition to formulating the query plan.
If the source collection is large or the pipeline is suboptimal, it will take a while to return the explain plan result.
```javascript
    //aggregate plan
const c = await db.collection(COLLECITON_NAME).aggregate(pipeline)
const result = await c.explain("executionStats")
const executionStats = {
   nReturned: 1,
   totalKeysExamined: 1,
   totalDocsExamined: 1,
   executionStages: {
      stage: 'FETCH',
      nReturned: 1,
      works: 2,
      advanced: 1,
      docsExamined: 1,
      inputStage: {
         stage: 'IXSCAN',
         nReturned: 1,
         works: 2,
         advanced: 1,
         keyPattern: {
            customer_id: 1
         },
         indexName: 'customer_id_1',
         direction: 'forward',
         indexBounds: {
            customer_id: [
               '["tonijones@myemail.com", "tonijones@myemail.com"]'
            ]
         },
         keysExamined: 1
      }
   }
}
```
Here, this part of the plan also shows that the aggregation uses the existing index. Because totalKeysExamined and
totalDocsExamined match, the aggregation fully leverages this index to identify the required records, which is good
news. Nevertheless, the targeted index doesn't necessarily mean the aggregation's query part is fully optimised. For
example, if there is the need to reduce latency further, you can do some analysis to determine if the index can
completely cover the query. Suppose the cursor query part of the aggregation is satisfied entirely using the index and
does not have to examine any raw documents. In that case, you will see totalDocsExamined: 0 in the explain plan.

### Pipeline Performance Considerations

Explain Plans, the tool you should use to identify opportunities for optimisation is the explain plan.
You will typically use the explain plan during the final stages of your pipeline's development once it is functionally
correct.

some guiding principles regarding performance valuable when explain plan is analysed sub-optimal pipeline

This chapter outlines three crucial tips to assist you when creating and tuning an aggregation pipeline. For sizeable
data sets, adopting these principles may mean the difference between aggregations completing in a few seconds versus
minutes, hours or even longer.

1. Be Cognizant Of Streaming Vs Blocking Stages Ordering
   When executing an aggregation pipeline, the database engine pulls batches of records from the initial query cursor
   generated against the source collection. The database engine then attempts to stream each batch through the
   aggregation pipeline stages. For most types of stages, referred to as streaming stages, the database engine will take
   the processed batch from one stage and immediately stream it into the next part of the pipeline. It will do this
   without waiting for all the other batches to arrive at the prior stage. However, two types of stages must block and
   wait for all batches to arrive and accumulate together at that stage. These two stages are referred to as blocking
   stages and specifically, the two types of stages that block are:

$sort
$group *

* actually when stating $group, this also includes other less frequently used "grouping" stages too, specifically:
  $bucket, $bucketAuto, $count, $sortByCount & $facet  (it's a stretch to call $facet a group stage, but in the context
  of this topic, it's best to think of it that way)

The diagram below highlights the nature of streaming and blocking stages. Streaming stages allow batches to be processed
and then passed through without waiting. Blocking stages wait for the whole of the input data set to arrive and
accumulate before processing all this data together.

MongoDB aggregation pipeline streaming Vs blocking stages

When considering $sort and $group stages, it becomes evident why they have to block. The following examples illustrate
why this is the case:

$sort blocking example: A pipeline must sort people in ascending order of age. If the stage only sorts each batch's
content before passing the batch on to the pipeline's result, only individual batches of output records are sorted by
age but not the whole result set.

$group blocking example: A pipeline must group employees by one of two work departments (either the sales or
manufacturing departments). If the stage only groups employees for a batch, before passing it on, the final result
contains the work departments repeated multiple times. Each duplicate department consists of some but not all of its
employees.

These often unavoidable blocking stages don't just increase aggregation execution time by reducing concurrency. If used
without careful forethought, the throughput and latency of a pipeline will slow dramatically due to significantly
increased memory consumption. The following sub-sections explore why this occurs and tactics to mitigate this.

$sort Memory Consumption And Mitigation
Used na√Øvely, a $sort stage will need to see all the input records at once, and so the host server must have enough
capacity to hold all the input data in memory. The amount of memory required depends heavily on the initial data size
and the degree to which the prior stages can reduce the size. Also, multiple instances of the aggregation pipeline may
be in-flight at any one time, in addition to other database workloads. These all compete for the same finite memory.
Suppose the source data set is many gigabytes or even terabytes in size, and earlier pipeline stages have not reduced
this size significantly. It will be unlikely that the host machine has sufficient memory to support the pipeline's
blocking $sort stage. Therefore, MongoDB enforces that every blocking stage is limited to 100 MB of consumed RAM. The
database throws an error if it exceeds this limit.

To avoid the memory limit obstacle, you can set the allowDiskUse:true option for the overall aggregation for handling
large result data sets. Consequently, the pipeline's sort operation spills to disk if required, and the 100 MB limit no
longer constrains the pipeline. However, the sacrifice here is significantly higher latency, and the execution time is
likely to increase by orders of magnitude.

To circumvent the aggregation needing to manifest the whole data set in memory or overspill to disk, attempt to refactor
your pipeline to incorporate one of the following approaches (in order of most effective first):

Use Index Sort. If the $sort stage does not depend on a $unwind, $group or $project stage preceding it, move the $sort
stage to near the start of your pipeline to target an index for the sort. The aggregation runtime does not need to
perform an expensive in-memory sort operation as a result. The $sort stage won't necessarily be the first stage in your
pipeline because there may also be a $match stage that takes advantage of the same index. Always inspect the explain
plan to ensure you are inducing the intended behaviour.

Use Limit With Sort. If you only need the first subset of records from the sorted set of data, add a $limit stage
directly after the $sort stage, limiting the results to the fixed amount you require (e.g. 10). At runtime, the
aggregation engine will collapse the $sort and $limit into a single special internal sort stage which performs both
actions together. The in-flight sort process only has to track the ten records in memory, which currently satisfy the
executing sort/limit rule. It does not have to hold the whole data set in memory to execute the sort successfully.

Reduce Records To Sort. Move the $sort stage to as late as possible in your pipeline and ensure earlier stages
significantly reduce the number of records streaming into this late blocking $sort stage. This blocking stage will have
fewer records to process and less thirst for RAM.

$group Memory Consumption And Mitigation
Like the $sort stage, the $group stage has the potential to consume a large amount of memory. The aggregation pipeline's
100 MB RAM limit for blocking stages applies equally to the $group stage because it will potentially pressure the host's
memory capacity. As with sorting, you can use the pipeline's allowDiskUse:true option to avoid this limit for
heavyweight grouping operations, but with the same downsides.

In reality, most grouping scenarios focus on accumulating summary data such as totals, counts, averages, highs and lows,
and not itemised data. In these situations, considerably reduced result data sets are produced, requiring far less
processing memory than a $sort stage. Contrary to many sorting scenarios, grouping operations will typically demand a
fraction of the host's RAM.

To ensure you avoid excessive memory consumption when you are looking to use a $group stage, adopt the following
principles:

Avoid Unnecessary Grouping. This chapter covers this recommendation in far greater detail in the section 2. Avoid
Unwinding & Regrouping Documents Just To Process Array Elements.

Group Summary Data Only. If the use case permits it, use the group stage to accumulate things like totals, counts and
summary roll-ups only, rather than holding all the raw data of each record belonging to a group. The Aggregation
Framework provides a robust set of accumulator operators to help you achieve this inside a $group stage.

2. Avoid Unwinding & Regrouping Documents Just To Process Array Elements
   Sometimes, you need an aggregation pipeline to mutate or reduce an array field's content for each record. For
   example:

You may need to add together all the values in the array into a total field
You may need to retain the first and last elements of the array only
You may need to retain only one recurring field for each sub-document in the array
...or numerous other array "reduction" scenarios
To bring this to life, imagine a retail orders collection where each document contains an array of products purchased as
part of the order, as shown in the example below:

[
{
_id: 1197372932325,
products: [
{
prod_id: 'abc12345',
name: 'Asus Laptop',
price: NumberDecimal('429.99')
}
]
},
{
_id: 4433997244387,
products: [
{
prod_id: 'def45678',
name: 'Karcher Hose Set',
price: NumberDecimal('23.43')
},
{
prod_id: 'jkl77336',
name: 'Picky Pencil Sharpener',
price: NumberDecimal('0.67')
},
{
prod_id: 'xyz11228',
name: 'Russell Hobbs Chrome Kettle',
price: NumberDecimal('15.76')
}
]
}
]
The retailer wants to see a report of all the orders but only containing the expensive products purchased by customers (
e.g. having just products priced greater than 15 dollars). Consequently, an aggregation is required to filter out the
inexpensive product items of each order's array. The desired aggregation output might be:

[
{
_id: 1197372932325,
products: [
{
prod_id: 'abc12345',
name: 'Asus Laptop',
price: NumberDecimal('429.99')
}
]
},
{
_id: 4433997244387,
products: [
{
prod_id: 'def45678',
name: 'Karcher Hose Set',
price: NumberDecimal('23.43')
},
{
prod_id: 'xyz11228',
name: 'Russell Hobbs Chrome Kettle',
price: NumberDecimal('15.76')
}
]
}
]
Notice order 4433997244387 now only shows two products and is missing the inexpensive product.

One na√Øve way of achieving this transformation is to unwind the products array of each order document to produce an
intermediate set of individual product records. These records can then be matched to retain products priced greater than
15 dollars. Finally, the products can be grouped back together again by each order's _id field. The required pipeline to
achieve this is below:

// SUBOPTIMAL

var pipeline = [
// Unpack each product from the each order's product as a new separate record
{"$unwind": {
"path": "$products",
}},

// Match only products valued over 15.00
{"$match": {
"products.price": {
"$gt": NumberDecimal("15.00"),
},
}},

// Group by product type
{"$group": {
"_id": "$_id",
"products": {"$push": "$products"},
}},
];
This pipeline is suboptimal because a $group stage has been introduced, which is a blocking stage, as outlined earlier
in this chapter. Both memory consumption and execution time will increase significantly, which could be fatal for a
large input data set. There is a far better alternative by using one of the Array Operators instead. Array Operators are
sometimes less intuitive to code, but they avoid introducing a blocking stage into the pipeline. Consequently, they are
significantly more efficient, especially for large data sets. Shown below is a far more economical pipeline, using the
$filter array operator, rather than the $unwind/$match/$group combination, to produce the same outcome:

// OPTIMAL

var pipeline = [
// Filter out products valued 15.00 or less
{"$set": {
"products": {
"$filter": {
"input": "$products",
"as": "product",
"cond": {"$gt": ["$$product.price", NumberDecimal("15.00")]},
}
},
}},
];
Unlike the suboptimal pipeline, the optimal pipeline will include "empty orders" in the results for those orders that
contained only inexpensive items. If this is a problem, you can include a simple $match stage at the start of the
optimal pipeline with the same content as the $match stage shown in the suboptimal example.

To reiterate, there should never be the need to use an $unwind/$group combination in an aggregation pipeline to
transform an array field's elements for each document in isolation. One way to recognise this anti-pattern is if your
pipeline contains a $group on a $_id field. Instead, use Array Operators to avoid introducing a blocking stage.
Otherwise, you will suffer a magnitude increase in execution time when the blocking group stage in your pipeline handles
more than 100 MB of in-flight data. Adopting this best practice may mean the difference between achieving the required
business outcome and abandoning the whole task as unachievable.

The primary use of an $unwind/$group combination is to correlate patterns across many records' arrays rather than
transforming the content within each input record's array only. For an illustration of an appropriate use of
$unwind/$group refer to this book's Unpack Array & Group Differently example.

3. Encourage Match Filters To Appear Early In The Pipeline
   Explore If Bringing Forward A Full Match Is Possible
   As discussed, the database engine will do its best to optimise the aggregation pipeline at runtime, with a particular
   focus on attempting to move the $match stages to the top of the pipeline. Top-level $match content will form part of
   the filter that the engine first executes as the initial query. The aggregation then has the best chance of
   leveraging an index. However, it may not always be possible to promote $match filters in such a way without changing
   the meaning and resulting output of an aggregation.

Sometimes, a $match stage is defined later in a pipeline to perform a filter on a field that the pipeline computed in an
earlier stage. The computed field isn't present in the pipeline's original input collection. Some examples are:

A pipeline where a $group stage creates a new total field based on an accumulator operator. Later in the pipeline, a
$match stage filters groups where each group's total is greater than 1000.

A pipeline where a $set stage computes a new total field value based on adding up all the elements of an array field in
each document. Later in the pipeline, a $match stage filters documents where the total is less than 50.

At first glance, it may seem like the match on the computed field is irreversibly trapped behind an earlier stage that
computed the field's value. Indeed the aggregation engine cannot automatically optimise this further. In some
situations, though, there may be a missed opportunity where beneficial refactoring is possible by you, the developer.

Take the following trivial example of a collection of customer order documents:

[
{
customer_id: 'elise_smith@myemail.com',
orderdate: ISODate('2020-05-30T08:35:52.000Z'),
value: NumberDecimal('9999')
}
{
customer_id: 'elise_smith@myemail.com',
orderdate: ISODate('2020-01-13T09:32:07.000Z'),
value: NumberDecimal('10101')
}
]
Let's assume the orders are in a Dollars currency, and each value field shows the order's value in cents. You may have
built a pipeline to display all orders where the value is greater than 100 dollars like below:

// SUBOPTIMAL

var pipeline = [
{"$set": {
"value_dollars": {"$multiply": [0.01, "$value"]}, // Converts cents to dollars
}},

{"$unset": [
"_id",
"value",
]},

{"$match": {
"value_dollars": {"$gte": 100}, // Peforms a dollar check
}},
];
The collection has an index defined for the value field (in cents). However, the $match filter uses a computed field,
value_dollars. When you view the explain plan, you will see the pipeline does not leverage the index. The $match is
trapped behind the $set stage (which computes the field) and cannot be moved to the pipeline's start. MongoDB's
aggregation engine tracks a field's dependencies across multiple stages in a pipeline. It can establish how far up the
pipeline it can promote fields without risking a change in the aggregation's behaviour. In this case, it knows that if
it moves the $match stage ahead of the $set stage, it depends on, things will not work correctly.

In this example, as a developer, you can easily make a pipeline modification that will enable this pipeline to be more
optimal without changing the pipeline's intended outcome. Change the $match filter to be based on the source field value
instead (greater than 10000 cents), rather than the computed field (greater than 100 dollars). Also, ensure the $match
stage appears before the $unset stage (which removes the value field). This change is enough to allow the pipeline to
run efficiently. Below is how the pipeline looks after you have made this change:

// OPTIMAL

var pipeline = [
{"$set": {
"value_dollars": {"$multiply": [0.01, "$value"]},
}},

{"$match": { // Moved to before the $unset
"value": {"$gte": 10000}, // Changed to perform a cents check
}},

{"$unset": [
"_id",
"value",
]},
];
This pipeline produces the same data output. However, when you look at its explain plan, it shows the database engine
has pushed the $match filter to the top of the pipeline and used an index on the value field. The aggregation is now
optimal because the $match stage is no longer "blocked" by its dependency on the computed field.

Explore If Bringing Forward A Partial Match Is Possible
There may be some cases where you can't unravel a computed value in such a manner. However, it may still be possible for
you to include an additional $match stage, to perform a partial match targeting the aggregation's query cursor. Suppose
you have a pipeline that masks the values of sensitive date_of_birth fields (replaced with computed masked_date fields).
The computed field adds a random number of days (one to seven) to each current date. The pipeline already contains a
$match stage with the filter masked_date > 01-Jan-2020. The runtime cannot optimise this to the top of the pipeline due
to the dependency on a computed value. Nevertheless, you can manually add an extra $match stage at the top of the
pipeline, with the filter date_of_birth > 25-Dec-2019. This new $match leverages an index and filters records seven days
earlier than the existing $match, but the aggregation's final output is the same. The new $match may pass on a few more
records than intended. However, later on, the pipeline applies the existing filter masked_date > 01-Jan-2020 that will
naturally remove surviving surplus records before the pipeline completes.

Pipeline Match Summary
In summary, if you have a pipeline leveraging a $match stage and the explain plan shows this is not moving to the start
of the pipeline, explore whether manually refactoring will help. If the $match filter depends on a computed value,
examine if you can alter this or add an extra $match to yield a more efficient pipeline.
