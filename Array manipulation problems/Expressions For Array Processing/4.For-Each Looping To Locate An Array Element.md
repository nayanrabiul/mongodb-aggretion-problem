### "For-Each" Looping To Locate An Array Element
Below is an example of one building's data you might load into the database, with its array of rooms and their dimensions in metres:
The result should contain a newly added field, firstLargeEnoughRoomArrayIndex, to indicate the array position of the first room found to have area greater than 60m²

```js
db.buildings.insertOne(
    {
        "building": "WestAnnex-1",
        "room_sizes": [
            {"width": 9, "length": 5},
            {"width": 8, "length": 7},
            {"width": 7, "length": 9},
            {"width": 9, "length": 8},
        ]
    }
);

const output = {
    building: 'WestAnnex-1',
    room_sizes: [
        { width: 9, length: 5 },
        { width: 8, length: 7 },
        { width: 7, length: 9 },
        { width: 9, length: 8 }
    ],
    firstLargeEnoughRoomArrayIndex: 2
}
```

Below is a suitable pipeline that iterates through the room array elements capturing the position of the first one with a calculated area greater than 60m²:
```js
var pipeline = [{
    "$set": {
        "firstLargeEnoughRoomArrayIndex": {
            "$reduce": {
                "input": {
                    "$range": [0, {"$size": "$room_sizes"}]}, 
                    "initialValue": -1, 
                    "in": {
                        "$cond": {
                            "if": {
                                "$and": [
                                    // IF ALREADY FOUND DON'T CONSIDER SUBSEQUENT ELEMENTS
                                    {"$lt": ["$$value", 0]},
                                    // IF WIDTH x LENGTH > 60
                                    {
                                        "$gt": [
                                                {
                                                    "$multiply": [
                                                        {
                                                            "$getField": {
                                                                "input": {"$arrayElemAt": ["$room_sizes", "$$this"]}, 
                                                                "field": "width"
                                                            }
                                                        },
                                                        {
                                                            "$getField": {
                                                                "input": {"$arrayElemAt": ["$room_sizes", "$$this"]}, "field": "length"
                                                            }
                                                        },
                                                    ]                                        
                                                },
                                            60
                                        ]
                                    }]
                            },
                            // IF ROOM SIZE IS BIG ENOUGH CAPTURE ITS ARRAY POSITION
                            "then": "$$this",
                            // IF ROOM SIZE NOT BIG ENOUGH RETAIN EXISTING VALUE (-1)
                            "else": "$$value"
                        }
                    }
            }
        }
    }
}];
db.buildings.aggregate(pipeline);
```
#### explanaiton
However, the pipeline uses rangle for its input rather than the existing array field in each source document.
The $range operator is used to create this sequence which has the same size as the rooms array field of each document.
The pipeline uses this approach to track the array position of the matching room using the $$this variable.
For each iteration, the pipeline calculates the array room element's area. If the size is greater than 60, 
the pipeline assigns the current array position (represented by $$this) to the final result (represented by $$value).

#### problem of this approch
The "iterator" array expressions have no concept of a break command that procedural programming languages typically provide.
Therefore, even though the executing logic may have already located a room of sufficient size, the looping process will continue through the remaining array elements.
Consequently, the pipeline logic must include a check during each iteration to avoid overriding the final value (the $$value variable) if it already has a value.
Naturally, for massive arrays containing a few hundred or more elements, an aggregation pipeline will incur a noticeable latency impact when iterating the remaining 
array members even though the logic has already identified the required element.

#### possible sollution
Suppose you just wanted to return the first matching array element for a room with sufficient floor space, not its index.In that case, the pipeline can be more straightforward, 
using $first  operator  then  $filter to grab just the first element from the filter.
You would use a pipeline similar to the following:

```js
var pipeline = [
    {"$set": {
            "firstLargeEnoughRoom": {
                "$first": {
                    "$filter": {
                        "input": "$room_sizes",
                        "as": "room",
                        "cond": {
                            "$gt": [
                                {"$multiply": ["$$room.width", "$$room.length"]},
                                60
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }}
];
db.buildings.aggregate(pipeline);

//This pipeline produces the following output:
   const output =  [
        {
            _id: ObjectId("637b4b8a86fac07908ef98b3"),
            building: 'WestAnnex-1',
            room_sizes: [
                { width: 9, length: 5 },
                { width: 8, length: 7 },
                { width: 7, length: 9 },
                { width: 9, length: 8 }
            ],
            firstLargeEnoughRoom: { width: 7, length: 9 }
        }
    ]


// In reality, the array of rooms would be likely to also include an ID for each building's room, for example:

"room_sizes": [
    {"roomId": "Mercury", "width": 9, "length": 5},
    {"roomId": "Venus", "width": 8, "length": 7},
    {"roomId": "Jupiter", "width": 7, "length": 9},
    {"roomId": "Saturn", "width": 9, "length": 8},
]

```
Consequently, firstLargeEnoughRoom: { roomId: "Jupiter", width: 7, length: 9 } would be the first element returned from the filtering pipeline stage,
giving you the room's ID, so there would be no need to obtain the array's index for this particular use case.
However, the previous example, using the $reduce based pipeline, is helpful for more complicated situations where you do need the index of the matching array element.

most of the real-life cases,getting the items necessary rather than its index.
