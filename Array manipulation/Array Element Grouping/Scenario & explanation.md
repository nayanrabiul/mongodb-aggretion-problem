### Scenario
You want to provide a report for your online game showing the total "coin" rewards each gaming user has accumulated. The challenge is that the source collection captures each time the game awards a user with a type of coin in a growing array field containing many elements. However, for each gamer, you want to show totals for each coin type in an array instead. An extra complication exists in that you don't know ahead of time what all the possible coin types can be when developing the solution. For example, the game could introduce different coin types in the future (e.g. "tungsten coins").
